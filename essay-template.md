# Chronological Snobbery: The Tyranny of the Calendar

We live under a strange dictatorship—the tyranny of the calendar. This despot whispers that whatever bears a recent date stamp must be superior to whatever came before, that time itself serves as a reliable judge of truth and value. C.S. Lewis named this peculiar form of intellectual arrogance "[chronological snobbery](/lab/chronological-snobbery.html)," and once you see it, you cannot unsee its influence everywhere.

The technology sector offers the most obvious examples. How often do we hear that a programming language, framework, or methodology is outdated simply because it's five years old? Never mind that COBOL still powers global banking systems, or that Unix principles from the 1970s remain foundational to modern computing. The mere fact of age becomes sufficient grounds for dismissal.

But chronological snobbery extends far beyond technology. In education, we assume newer pedagogical theories must be improvements over older ones, despite mixed evidence. In design, we dismiss Victorian aesthetics as "cluttered" without considering the cultural and functional contexts that made such richness meaningful. In philosophy, students learn to view medieval scholastics as quaint curiosities rather than sophisticated thinkers grappling with enduring questions.

This temporal prejudice operates through a curious inversion of the burden of proof. Normally, new ideas must prove themselves against established ones. But chronological snobbery flips this relationship: old ideas must justify their continued existence against the simple fact of their age. It's intellectual guilty-until-proven-innocent.

The error corrupts our relationship with both past and present. When we assume newer equals better, we lose access to accumulated wisdom. Practices that evolved over centuries to solve real problems get discarded for untested innovations. Traditional crafts, time-tested social arrangements, and hard-won cultural knowledge disappear not because they've been proven inferior, but because they seem unfashionable.

Simultaneously, we burden the present with impossible expectations. Every new idea arrives pre-loaded with the assumption that it represents progress. We mistake change for improvement and innovation for advancement. The result is a restless pursuit of novelty that often leads nowhere productive.

The antidote to chronological snobbery requires what Lewis called "chronological humility"—the recognition that every era produces both wisdom and folly, insights and errors. Before dismissing something as outdated, we must ask harder questions: What problems was this designed to solve? What evidence convinced intelligent people this was valuable? What has actually changed to make this obsolete?

This doesn't mean older is automatically better—that would be chronological snobbery's equally fallacious inverse. Rather, it means evaluating ideas based on their actual merits rather than their birth certificates. A good idea doesn't become bad because it's old, just as a bad idea doesn't become good because it's new.

Perhaps most importantly, chronological humility helps us recognize that we too live within time, not above it. Future generations will look back on our assumptions with the same mixture of appreciation and bewilderment that we bring to the past. The intellectual fashions we take for granted will seem as peculiar to them as medieval worldviews seem to us.

This perspective offers a curious form of liberation. When we stop assuming that being contemporary makes us automatically superior to our predecessors, we can approach both past and present with genuine curiosity. We can learn from traditions without being enslaved by them, embrace innovations without worshipping them, and recognize that wisdom has no expiration date.

The calendar makes a poor philosopher. Time may be the medium in which ideas develop, but it is not their judge. That responsibility belongs to reason, evidence, and careful thought—tools that work as well today as they did centuries ago, and will work as well centuries hence.
