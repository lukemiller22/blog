This is an example of applying tufte-css to reST markup.{^This is a sidenote explaining something.}

## The Beauty of Simplicity 

Edward Tufte's approach to information design emphasizes clarity and simplicity.{^Edward Tufte is a statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University.} His principles have influenced not just print design, but web design as well.

Some key principles include:

- **High data-to-ink ratio**: Remove unnecessary visual elements
- **Integration of text and graphics**: Charts and text should work together seamlessly  
- **Layered information**: Present information at multiple levels of detail
- **Small multiples**: Show comparisons through repeated design elements

## Why Tufte CSS?

Tufte CSS brings these design principles to the web.{+This is a margin note - it doesn't have a number like sidenotes do.} It provides:

1. Beautiful typography with the ET Book font family
2. Sidenotes instead of footnotes{^Sidenotes are much better than footnotes because they don't interrupt the reading flow.}
3. Clean, minimal layouts
4. Responsive design that works on all devices

The result is web content that is both beautiful and highly readable.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing Tufte CSS in your own projects, remember:

- Use sidenotes sparingly and only when they add real value
- Keep your color palette minimal 
- Let whitespace do the heavy lifting in your design{+Whitespace is not wasted space - it's a design element that improves readability.}
- Focus on content hierarchy through typography, not decoration

This philosophy guides both the original Tufte designs and this CSS implementation.{^Tufte's books like "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" are masterclasses in information design.}
