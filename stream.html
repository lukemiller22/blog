          <p>Encountered C.S. Lewis's term "chronological snobbery" today while reading <em>Surprised by Joy</em>. Lewis defines it as "the uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate common to our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited." It's a particularly insidious form of intellectual pride—dismissing ideas simply because they're old rather than engaging with their actual merit. Owen Barfield helped Lewis overcome this tendency, and Lewis credits this correction as crucial to his intellectual development.</p>

          <p>Reading Mortimer Adler's introduction to the Syntopicon has me thinking about the challenge of organizing ideas across disciplines and centuries. His concept of "great ideas" as recurring themes in human thought provides a useful framework for synthesis. The challenge is finding the right level of abstraction—specific enough to be meaningful, general enough to connect across contexts.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Stumbled across Richard Feynman's technique for understanding: if you can't explain something simply, you don't really understand it. This connects to Einstein's supposed quote about explaining things to a six-year-old, though that attribution is questionable. The principle remains sound: true comprehension manifests in the ability to teach.</p>
