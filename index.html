    <h1>Luke Miller</h1>
    
    <p>I'm a product manager, writer, and lifelong learner exploring the intersections of faith, technology, and human flourishing. This site serves as a collection of my thoughts and <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, including my experiment in public learning through structured notes and various forms of <a href="writing.html">writing</a>.</p>

    <p>You'll find me working through ideas in different genres—essays, patterns, articles, and other forms that help me develop both my thinking and my voice. I'm particularly interested in how we organize knowledge and express it clearly. My <a href="/reading.html">reading</a> tends to focus on theology, philosophy, and the craft of writing itself, though I'm always open to recommendations that might surprise me.</p>

    <p>Beyond the written word, I'm slowly building a <a href="/glossary.html">glossary</a> of useful concepts and a curated collection of passages I call a <a href="/chrestomathy.html">chrestomathy</a>—both attempts to gather wisdom worth revisiting. I'm also working on a better way to organize and appreciate the thousands of family <a href="/photos.html">photos</a> that currently sit overwhelming and undervalued in cloud storage.</p>

    <p>If you're curious about the person behind these projects, you can learn more <a href="/about.html">about</a> my story, my family, and what drives this work. Most of what I'm thinking about lately lives in my public notes, and longer reflections find their way into posts here.</p>
