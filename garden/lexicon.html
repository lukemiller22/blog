                <p>This lexicon serves as a living repository of concepts, terms, and ideas that shape how I understand the world. Influenced by C.S. Lewis's <em>Studies in Words</em> and Ambrose Bierce's <em>Devil's Dictionary</em>, each entry attempts to capture not just definitions but the texture and nuance of meaning.</p>

                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The logical fallacy of assuming that whatever is newer in time is necessarily superior in quality, truth, or value; conversely, the automatic dismissal of older ideas, practices, or beliefs solely on the basis of their age.</p>

                        <p><strong>Etymology:</strong> Coined by C.S. Lewis in his 1955 Cambridge inaugural lecture "De Descriptione Temporum." Lewis attributes the concept to discussions with Owen Barfield, who helped him recognize this pattern in his own thinking.</p>
