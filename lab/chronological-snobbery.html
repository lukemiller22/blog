            <div class="pattern-definition">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>The logical fallacy of assuming that whatever is newer in time is necessarily superior in quality, truth, or value; conversely, the automatic dismissal of older ideas, practices, or beliefs solely on the basis of their age.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern-etymology">
                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>Coined by C.S. Lewis in his 1955 Cambridge inaugural lecture "De Descriptione Temporum." Lewis attributes the concept to discussions with Owen Barfield, who helped him recognize this pattern in his own thinking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern-examples">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p><strong>In Technology:</strong> "Why would anyone use vim when VS Code exists?"</p>
                <p><strong>In Philosophy:</strong> "Medieval scholastics were obviously wrong because they lived before the Enlightenment."</p>
                <p><strong>In Design:</strong> "That website looks terrible - it's from 2010."</p>
                <p><strong>In Business:</strong> "We need to modernize our approach; this strategy is five years old."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern-antidote">
                <h2>Antidote Pattern</h2>
                <p>Before dismissing something as outdated, ask: "What problems was this designed to solve? What evidence convinced intelligent people this was valuable? What has actually changed to make this obsolete?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern-related">
                <h2>Related Fallacies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appeal to novelty</li>
                    <li>Appeal to tradition (inverse error)</li>
                    <li>Historical determinism</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern-essay">
                <h2>Mini Essay</h2>
                <p>The peculiar arrogance of chronological snobbery lies not in preferring the new, but in the assumption that time itself serves as judge and jury. We imagine a great cosmic courtroom where ideas are automatically sentenced based on their birth date rather than their merits.</p>
                
                <p>This fallacy corrupts both directions of time. The progressive commits chronological snobbery by assuming newer equals better; the traditionalist commits its inverse by assuming older equals better. Both substitute temporal position for actual evaluation.</p>
                
                <p>Consider the software engineer who dismisses COBOL as "legacy garbage" without understanding that it still powers much of global banking because it solves certain problems remarkably well. Or the designer who assumes modern minimalism is inherently superior to Victorian ornamentation, ignoring the specific cultural and functional contexts that made such richness meaningful.</p>
                
                <p>The antidote requires intellectual humility: recognizing that every era produces both wisdom and folly, and that our task is to separate wheat from chaff based on evidence and reasoning, not on the accident of when we happened to be born.</p>
