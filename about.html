      <section>
        <p>I'm Luke Miller, and this is my attempt to tend a corner of the digital commons. This site is part commonplace book, part laboratory, part garden—a place where ideas can grow and connect across time and discipline.</p>

        <p>The structure reflects my belief that knowledge work benefits from multiple passes and different levels of organization. Raw observations flow through the <strong>Stream</strong>. The <strong>Lab</strong> applies patterns and templates to develop these observations into more structured forms. The <strong>Garden</strong> collects related patterns into larger, living documents. <strong>Essays</strong> represent more complete thoughts, ready for public consideration.</p>

        <p>This approach owes debts to many thinkers and practitioners:
        
        <label for="sn-influences" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-influences" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">Among others: Mortimer Adler's Syntopicon, Richard Hamming's approach to research, Andy Matuschak's evergreen notes, and the tradition of commonplace books from Erasmus to Darwin.</span>
        
        The goal is not original insight but useful synthesis—finding connections between ideas that might otherwise remain isolated.</p>

        <p>The design uses Edward Tufte's CSS framework because it embodies principles I value: clarity, respect for the reader's intelligence, and integration of text with supporting material. The two-column layout allows main arguments to breathe while keeping context close at hand.</p>

        <p>All content is generated from periodic JSON exports of my Roam Research graph, then processed through scripts that maintain the structure while adapting to web format. This keeps the writing process close to thinking while making the results publicly accessible.</p>

        <p>If you find ideas here worth developing, borrowing, or challenging, I welcome conversation. The best thinking happens in dialogue.</p>
