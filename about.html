      <h1>About</h1>

      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>Bowing down in blind credulity before mere authority and tradition, I am firmly of the opinion that I was born in 1985. I don't remember the occasion, and I have not been able to test the story by experiment or private judgment, but I accept the account as passed down to me by my parents and as stated on my birth certificate. If there was an adoption story, I assume I would have heard it by now.</p>
      
      <p>I count my parents as one of God's most gracious gifts in my life. I don't know anyone more generous, sincere, and hard-working. When I first heard about God's unconditional love for me, there was no disconnect in my little heart. I had already experienced this kind of love from my parents. They are godly, humble, and loving, and I deeply grateful for them.</p>

      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>I was born in the 80's, my childhood memories are filed in the 90's. When I was 5, my father took a pastorate in the Central Valley. I don't remember a lot about the move. I do remember it was hot when we arrived that summer.</p>
      
      <p>It was also around this time that I came to faith in Jesus Christ. I remember nothing from the actual conversation with my mom, but that doesn't trouble me. After all, we are not justified by conversation. We are justified by faith. And faith is not something you profess at some point in the past. It's something you possess in the present.</p>
      
      <p>To borrow a metaphor I read somewhere, it is not necessary to know when and how you sat down in the chair, so long as you know you are sitting there now.</p>

      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>I spent my childhood in Clovis, California. Most of my memories of those years are shaped by Little League, youth group, and long summers with not much to do. I was homeschooled from the 5th grade on, which was wonderful for me. I got to read a lot more, sleep in, and spend time with my parents.</p>
      
      <p>I went to a small Christian college in Southern California where I studied philosophy and met my wife. We were married in 2008, the year after we graduated.</p>

      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>After college, we moved back to the Central Valley where I worked for a few years in banking and then started a small business. In 2015, we moved to Austin, Texas, where I co-founded <a href="https://buildonline.io">Buildonline</a>, a company that helps businesses build better websites and online presence.</p>
      
      <p>We have three children who bring us great joy and keep us very busy. They are the light of our lives and a constant reminder of God's goodness to us.</p>

      <h2>V</h2>
      <p>I love reading, writing, and thinking about ideas. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of faith, culture, and technology. I believe that the Christian faith has something important to say about how we live in the digital age, and I'm trying to work out what that means in my own life and work.</p>
      
      <p>This website is my attempt to think through some of these questions in public. I write about books I've read, ideas I'm wrestling with, and observations about life in the modern world. I hope you'll find something here that's helpful or interesting.</p>
