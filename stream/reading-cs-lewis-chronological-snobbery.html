            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Just finished Lewis's essay "De Descriptione Temporum" where he coins the term "chronological snobbery" - the uncritical acceptance that newer is automatically better.</p>
                
                <p>He defines it as "the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited." The temptation to dismiss older ideas simply because they're old, without examining their actual merit.</p>
                
                <p>What strikes me is how this applies beyond just intellectual history. We see it in technology adoption, cultural criticism, even personal relationships. The newest framework, the latest methodology, the most recent theory - all presumed superior by virtue of recency.</p>
                
                <p>Lewis suggests the antidote is asking not "when was this believed?" but "why did intelligent people believe this, and what evidence convinced them?" A much harder but more honest question.</p>
                
                <p>Worth noting: this doesn't mean older is better either. Just that age alone - whether great or small - tells us nothing about truth value.</p>
