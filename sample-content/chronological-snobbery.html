        <h2>Pronunciation</h2>
        <p>/ˌkrɒnəˈlɒdʒɪkəl ˈsnɒbəri/</p>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate common to our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>Coined by C.S. Lewis in collaboration with Owen Barfield during their philosophical discussions at Oxford. The term combines "chronological" (relating to time) with "snobbery" (an attitude of superiority based on superficial criteria).</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Common manifestations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dismissing classical education methods without examining their effectiveness</li>
          <li>Assuming newer psychological theories are automatically superior to older insights about human nature</li>
          <li>Rejecting traditional wisdom practices without considering their empirical results</li>
          <li>Believing contemporary moral frameworks are necessarily more enlightened than historical ones</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Related Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Presentism:</strong> The anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas into historical contexts</li>
          <li><strong>Whig History:</strong> The interpretation of history as inevitable progress toward the present</li>
          <li><strong>Recency Bias:</strong> The tendency to weigh recent events more heavily than earlier ones</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Primary Sources</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Lewis, C.S. <em>Surprised by Joy</em>, Chapter 13</li>
          <li>Lewis, C.S. "De Descriptione Temporum" (Inaugural Lecture at Cambridge, 1954)</li>
          <li>Barfield, Owen. <em>History, Guilt and Habit</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Understanding chronological snobbery helps in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Academic research requiring historical perspective</li>
          <li>Evaluating the merit of ideas independent of their temporal origin</li>
          <li>Avoiding intellectual fashion and maintaining critical distance from contemporary consensus</li>
          <li>Recognizing the cyclical nature of many intellectual debates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Lewis credited Barfield with helping him overcome his own chronological snobbery, particularly regarding medieval and Renaissance thought. This correction proved crucial to Lewis's intellectual development and his later ability to engage seriously with pre-modern Christian theology.
        
        <label for="sn-barfield" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-barfield" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">Barfield's influence on Lewis extended beyond this single concept to include a broader appreciation for the evolution of consciousness and the historical development of human thinking.</span>
        
        The concept remains particularly relevant in academic disciplines where temporal chauvinism can blind scholars to valuable insights from earlier periods.</p>
